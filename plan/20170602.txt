DUE 6/2
  - Fix bugs involving HELP button
  	- Bug: Hovering over "X" brings the user to a hallway that isn't interactable
	- Bug: Clicking on "X" returns the user to the hospital page
	- Bug: Hovering over help brings the user to the bubblesort animation page (inefficient, especially if by accident)
	- Bug: The help page can be accessed regardless of what room the user is in
	- Bug: Bubblesort is not animated
  - Dementia room and corresponding tasks
  	- New user should bring the present to the OCD room
	- OCD room task involves knight's tour (should be interactable)
	- Upon completion of the task, the Schizophrenia room is unlocked
  
WEEKEND:
  - Schizophrenia room
  	- New user and new background 
  	- Final task includes multiple questions and priority queue
	- End scene with a conclusive (hopeful) message
  - Add more in-line comments
  - Beautify (e.g. animations, smoother user movement)
  - Refining code
