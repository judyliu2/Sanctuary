## LET ME OUT

### Description
This is a single-player educational RPG game based on the Japanese animated fantasy film, Spirited Away. This RPG aims to educate the user on various mental disorders, coded in Processing. The user will play as various characters of the movie, namely Yubaba, Haku and Chihiro. The user will encounter and must overcome tasks along the way, which require understanding of varius concepts such as sorting. Throughout the journey, various hints will aid the user in their pursuits with the use of the help button. Controls for movement of the character is also found when pressing the help button.

Keep in mind that the RPG is experienced in first person - that is, completion of each task forces the user to assume a different body under the influence of a different disorder.
