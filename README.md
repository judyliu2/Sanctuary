## LET ME OUT

### Description
This is a single-player educational RPG game that aims to educate the user on various mental disorders, coded in Processing. The user is first thrown into a mental asylum and must make decisions that lead to different scenarios. The user will encounter and must overcome tasks along the way, which require understanding of varius concepts (e.g. insertion sort, inheritance). Throughout the journey, various hints will aid the user to aid in their pursuits. 

Keep in mind that the RPG is experienced in first person - that is, completion of each task forces the user to assume a different body under the influence of a different disorder. There is no way to lose the game, but winning mandates the completion of all tasks.

#### Controls
- A - Move left
- D - Move right
- W - Jump (with gravity, of course)
- S - Interact with objects (e.g. entering doors)
